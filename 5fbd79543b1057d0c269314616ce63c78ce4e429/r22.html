  <span>You asked—again—when your card would arrive, and I nearly flashed the Notes app confessional. Your patience makes me want to chronicle us daily, to ink every coffee run and couch nap. Someday maybe we’ll co-author a journal dense with doodles and side-eye jokes; your prose would outshine mine, and I’d love every line. Until then, thank you for waiting with a smile. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: You asked me again today, when you are going to receive your card and I almost opened my phone with my notes app open. Your patience in receiving this card makes me want to journal about you every single day. I saw a post where a couple wrote down in a journal, everything they did together everyday for years. I know the prose would be so much more eloquent if you had the pen.</div>

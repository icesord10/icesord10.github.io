  <span>Some people whistle; I wait for your almost-snort laugh to echo down the hallway, the surest sign joy is in residence. Writing these letters I can already hear that sound bubbling up as you read—a preview better than any soundtrack. Your voice colors my memories in a shade I can’t find in any paint swatch. Keep laughing; it’s my favorite song. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: I was struck today by the sound of your voice and laugh. It’s something that always warms my heart and writing these reflections/letters have had me conjuring up different moments and thinking through how you will sound when you read these. Hearing you almost get to the point of snorting (like I do when I’m really taken by something) is one of the best sounds.</div>

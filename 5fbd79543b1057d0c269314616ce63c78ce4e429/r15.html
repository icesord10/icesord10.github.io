  <span>Last-minute Hadestown tickets after a raw-crab feast at Fish Cheeks—only you could choreograph chaos into art. While juggling moves, my manic work week, and my mom’s visit, you still folded grace into every corner. Your tenderness reminds me that urgency and gentleness can live in the same heartbeat. Thank you for holding space for everyone while never dropping the ball labeled “us.” -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: 5/30/2025 we just sporadically decided to see an amazing show (Hadestown) after dropping in for some unforgettable raw crab at Fishcheeks. Seeing you balance work, moving into a new home, supporting all of my hectic work craziness, and showing such tenderness and care for my mom this past week has been such a gift. You are so considerate of the feelings of others and I am incredibly grateful for the grace that you bring to hectic situations.</div>

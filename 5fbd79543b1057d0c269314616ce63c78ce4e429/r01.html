<div class="tooltip-container">
  <span>From the very first review on PeytonEats to the bold takes of Peytopia, your imagination pours out like sunlight through an open window. Whether you’re riffing in the writer’s room or calling shots from video village, you invite everyone into the backstage of your mind and hand them front-row seats. You translate sparks of whimsy into words, images, and flavors that feel unmistakably you—never dimming your voice to fit someone else’s taste. Watching you connect with strangers who leave laughing, inspired, and newly curious reminds me every day why the world needs your vision.</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: From PeytonEats to Peytopia, from the writer’s room to video village, you have an innate ability to captivate people. Readers to viewers, friends to strangers… I am so impressed by your ability to articulate your perspective on the world. You connect with everyone without attenuating who you are and what you say.</div>

<div class="tooltip-container">
  <span>You asked what I want for my birthday, and honestly it’s this: mornings that start with your laugh, meals that taste better because you steal the first bite, nights where the only plan is being together. Sneaking away to pen these reflections feels like wrapping twenty-five tiny presents, each one whispering I love you. Wherever we land—street cart or steakhouse—the menu reads differently when you’re across the table. Thank you for turning my every day into a celebration. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: 5/24/2025 You asked me what I want for my birthday today and I told you that I’m just so grateful that I get to spend it and every day with you. It’s been hard sneaking to do these reflections without you noticing but I hope that it will be worth it. I feel so lucky that I am able to share this life with you. Wherever I am with you, the food tastes better, the view looks nicer, the drink tastes better, and the company is incredible.</div>

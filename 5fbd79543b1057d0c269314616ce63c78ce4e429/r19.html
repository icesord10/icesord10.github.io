  <span>Flashback again: UCLA hospital corridors, your dad and Grandma Sue in limbo, and you—steadier than the heart monitors. Stress tried to write the script, but you rewrote it with calm, humor, and hard truths said gently. Your resilience isn’t loud; it’s the quiet hum that keeps the lights on when everything else flickers. I hope you see in yourself the strength I saw that day, and every day since. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: FLASHBACK wee woo wee woo… a colleague mentioned their family was dealing with some heal issues and I thought back to sitting with you in the UCLA hospital with your Dad and Grandma Sue on the way. Even though you were facing incredibly stressful circumstances (brought on by stress itself) you showed in that moment just how strong and resilient you are. I could tell you were scared but you brought a level head and positivity every time a doctor came in to check on you. In the car ride back and in the days after, I wanted to be careful not to stress you out but you never shyed away from uncomfortable conversations.</div>

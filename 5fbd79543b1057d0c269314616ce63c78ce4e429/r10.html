  <span>Flashback sirens still cue up our almost-kiss like a favorite movie trailer: dinner, Kiss Kiss Womp Womp, and sparks that felt rehearsed by destiny. Somehow we had inside jokes before our first joke was told. Every discovery since then—big, tiny, ridiculous—feels like turning the page of a story we were both already reading. Grateful we shook hands on being tier-one friends and immediately broke the contract with a smile. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: FLASHBACK wee woo wee woo… I frequently find myself thinking/talking about our first almost kiss. Beyond the romcom worthy story of dinner -> Kiss Kiss Womp Womp, it felt the entire night like it was us against the world. Like we had inside jokes that had never been said. There are so many things that we have learned about each other since that first date, but part of me felt like we already knew these things instinctively that night. I am so grateful for every day with you and I am so grateful we shook hands on being tier 1 friends.</div>

  <span>Over ten CornerStreet sandwiches later, I still haven’t set foot inside the place—because you keep bringing warmth to me instead of making me chase it. You give soup to the sick, shoulders to the weary, and therapist-slash-comedian time slots to Dana at 2 a.m. The world feels bigger and softer because you refuse to let anyone feel small or alone. Thank you for feeding stomachs and souls in equal measure. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: 5/31/2025 Walked to CornerStreet with my mom before the plane today and I realized that I have eaten 10+ sandwiches without ever stepping food in the restaurant. You selflessly support others. Helping your friends when they are going through difficult situations. Making me soup and freezing it so I have some warmth on days when you aren’t there. Bending over backwards to support Dana when she really needs a therapist, friend, and psychiatrist all at the same time. The world is so much better with you in it.</div>

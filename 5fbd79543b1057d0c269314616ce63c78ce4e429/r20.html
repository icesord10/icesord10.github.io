  <span>Coming home to you after a hurricane week reminds me that you’re a master of emotional weather: matching the storm’s roar or ushering in calm with equal ease. You treat feelings like honored guests—welcomed, heard, then politely shown the door when the visit’s over. Rumi would applaud how gracefully you run that guesthouse. Thank you for teaching me that adaptability isn’t just survival; it’s art. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: Coming back home to you after a long week and trying day makes me appreciate range that is P. When live gets crazy, you meet the craziness and out match it. When life calms down, you ease the stress in the eye of the storm. When sad things happen you take time to process the emotions. You are so adaptable and find ways to amplify the world around you. I’ve always liked the Rumi quote that you are not your emotions, you are a guesthouse and you should welcome each feeling as a guest, allow them in, and them let them leave. You are so skilled at this.</div>

  <span>Building this little website scaffolding made me remember your birthday blow-out last year and the friendly wager that we’d try to top ourselves every occasion. Good—because out-loving each other is the competition I plan to lose gloriously. You pour your whole self into projects, people, and especially “us,” and I’ve got the best seat in the house. Thank you for turning ambition into affection. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: I started to put together the scaffolding for this site today and was thinking about your birthday party last year. I heard someone say something to the effect of “you are going to drive yourself crazy trying to one up each other every holiday”. Good. You pour yourself into everything you do. You pour yourself into our relationship. You pour yourself into life. I am so grateful to have front row seat to you and your love.</div>

  <span>Twenty-five days of Twenty-five-year-old P in 2025: from Emily-in-Paris prep to Museum Mile strolls with Olive, you make the globe feel pocket-sized. Traveling through your eyes means every monument tells a joke and every cafe turns into a home movie set. You show up for friends with the same gusto you show up for adventure—soap fiascos and mystery seat stains included. With you, even chaos stamps the passport of my heart. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: 6/10/2025. 25 days of 25 year old P in the year 2025. We have been watching Emily in Paris in preparation for PnG in Paris. You make traveling the world so exciting. Getting to see new places through your eyes is the best way to travel. You are out at Museum Mile with Olive and I am so impressed by how outgoing and engaging you are with your friends. You always think of how they may be doing and put yourself out there to support them and enjoy life with them. Whether it’s soap, pee, or cum on the seat and floor, I never worry about it when I’m with you.</div>

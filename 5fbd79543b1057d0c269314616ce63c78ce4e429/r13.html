<div class="tooltip-container">
  <span>I found one of your tucked-away notes and was catapulted back to Couple-to-Throuple marathons, COVID couch forts, and OyBar burger discoveries. Your tiny scribbles turn mundane errands—picking up cat food, watching you grin through a foggy mirror—into paused-time treasures. I stash every slip of paper like it’s a secret map because, with you, ordinary moments hide extraordinary joy. Keep writing; I’ll keep finding. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: I found a note you wrote in my bag upstairs while working today. Thinking back on all the time we spent as the least long distance, long distance couple, I love being reminded of the little things we enjoyed when we were together. Thinking I had nicotine withdrawals, learning we had COVID, and hunkering down to watch Couple to Throuple. Watching you sit on the toilet smiling through a fogged up mirror. Enjoying a slow morning with you. Walking through the Huntington garden smelling different roses. Picking up new cat food. Discovering OyBar burgers for the first time. I have stuffed so many of your notes in so many places because you always make me feel like we are savoring a moment when everything else is spinning around us.</div>

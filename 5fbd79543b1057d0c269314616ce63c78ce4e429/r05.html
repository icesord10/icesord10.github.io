  <span>Whether I’m grumbling about airport chaos or bargaining over $50 prosciutto, you meet my turbulence with the softest landing gear. Your patience with Rachel Berry-level theatrics or your dad’s plot-twist timelines reminds everyone that compassion can out-shout frustration. Even when our own passions flare, you recenter the room with a quiet strength that disarms and disarms until only love is left. Thank you for keeping us both grounded while never clipping our wings. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: Whether I’m having bad day at airport and upset about hearing you want to add $50 prosciutto to a pizza, I feel so lucky to have you and your patience on the other end of the line. You are patient with difficult people (Rachel Berry refusing to apologize or your dad’s inconsistent messaging on whether you are going to be a part of his application for the Extracted TV show) and discordant timelines (this “card” taking so long to arrive). Even when passion riles us up, your compassion towards others, and your ability to recenter is appreciated by everyone</div>

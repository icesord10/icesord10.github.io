  <span>Today’s Wharf reception had me wishing you’d been there to charm the room—because I know Derek, Tyler, Lisa, and Jason would still be raving while the restaurant stacked chairs. Sharing London’s buzz with you proved what I suspected: every professional win is sweeter when your hand is in mine. I’m counting the future boardrooms, greenrooms, and victory toasts we’ll conquer together. Your horizon is bright, and I love basking in its glow. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: 5/21/2025 I was reflecting today after the Axios event at the wharf on how you would have killed it talking to folks at the reception. Having you meet Derek/Tyler + Lisa/Jason in London was such a treat and feel so grateful to be able to sit next to you. Everyone loved you (no surprises there). Looking forward to all of the professional experiences we will get to share together + all of the amazing accomplishments you have garnered and all of the opportunities on the horizon for you.</div>

<div class="tooltip-container">
  <span>Your stopwatch ethic, even when fever-fogged, humbles me. You tally minutes not to impress a timesheet but to honor the trust others place in you—Elliot, Dana, Chelsea, family, furry roommates, me. Skill bends to your will because you work harder than the problem until it blossoms. I hope you hear, often and loudly, how many lives rise because you refuse to let them fall. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: I am so Impressed by your work ethic and integrity. Even when you are sick and tired, you have your stopwatch tracking every minute of work to be honest with the company. You are so skilled at whatever you put your mind to. You are deeply driven to support the people that rely on you - Elliot/Dana/Chelesea, your mom, your friends, Barney/Fred, me. People do not say enough, just how grateful they are for the impact that you have on their lives.

  <span>Manchester trains, three-minute sprints, and a too-confident Uber driver—every frantic moment felt perfect because you were beside me. A bargain “meal deal” became a feast, fish-and-chips tasted like a Michelin plate, and dancing in the dark toward that midnight burger turned the whole city into our jukebox. The loud nights thrill me, but it’s the quiet exhale in between that makes my heart click back into place. Thank you for choosing to run, stroll, and sometimes tumble through life with me. -G <3</span>
  <div class="tooltip-text">Prompt: 5/17/2025 Manchester - I am so grateful to be doing life with you. Rushing to make a train with 3 minutes to spare, fears only assuaged by a confident sounding uber driver. Riding through the countryside experiencing a meal deal together. Finally getting some (okay) fish and chips. Seeing an incredible show. Dancing in the dark all the way to a late night burger. The exciting nights are so fun, I enjoy the quiet relaxing ones just as much. Thank you.</div>
